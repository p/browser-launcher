# Browser Launcher

This is a collection of scripts to launch browsers configured in various ways.

## Major Features

- Pre-configure/populate profiles (e.g. preinstall extensions)
- Multiple-user operation (launch browsers under multiple independent user
accounts from a single master user account)
- Export browser profiles to readable state (e.g. SQL instead of binary SQLite
files, YAML instead of compressed Mozilla-prefixed JSON, etc.)
- Dump & import complete profiles
